## Smart Contracts (ERC)

Dynamically-created Smart Contracts ad-hoc. At your fingertips.

Functions are therefore added on-demand. Consider the example: a SC needing to reimburse the owner on every future sell roughly translates to (in git-style diff):

    /* <SC>.sol */
     
    + function <FUNC>(...) {
    + ...
    + }
  
Allowing for personalized use-cases.

Anything could be added, removed, changed, and deployed. NFTizer is Flexible, Easy to use, and Reliable.
